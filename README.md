## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile, I am passionate about creating innovative products at the intersection of knowledge management, big data and analytics.

🔭 __I’m currently working on__:  
- [no-chat](https://sea-turtle-app-klpab.ondigitalocean.app/display-combined/MSFT/94c3b0af980cd58aff77c4afe6b28488) Helps summarize and brainstorm about massive texts by relying less on chat and more on visual tools  !

- [Genna](https://github.com/md-experiments/genna3) (GENerative ANNotation system) <img alt='Genna logo' src='https://github.com/md-experiments/genna3/blob/new-FE/static/logo.png' width='40' align='left'/> is an LLM-centric text annotation system designed for efficient text annotation and comparison of LLM-as-a-Judge outputs.

- [simple-chat](https://github.com/md-experiments/simple-chat) A lightweight private chatGPT UI clone that can use different LLMs, store multiple chats, store history locally and, of course, "dark mode"

- [AI Storyteller](https://github.com/md-experiments/md-similacra) A generative AI tool that can write, voice and create a video from a short description
